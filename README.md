# Project Submission & Review - Data Analytics 

## Introduction

In this lesson, we review the requirements, submission, and review process for the Phase Projects.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Create project deliverables that meet Flatiron School requirements
* Submit your project deliverables in Canvas

## Create Your Project Deliverables

Complete the deliverables for your project, guided by the rubric at the bottom of the main project assignment in Canvas. Keep in mind that **the audience for these deliverables is not only your teacher, but also potential employers**. Employers will look at your project deliverables to evaluate multiple skills, including coding, analysis, communication, and domain knowledge. You will want to polish these as much as you can, both during the course and afterwards.

### Jupyter Notebook

Your Jupyter Notebook is the primary source of information about your analysis. At a minimum, it should contain or import all of the code used in your project and walk the reader through your project from start to finish. You may choose to use multiple Jupyter Notebooks in your project, but you should have one that provides a full project overview as a point of entry for visitors.

### Non-Technical Presentation (Slide Deck & Video)

Your non-technical presentation is your opportunity to communicate clearly and concisely about your project and it's real-world relevance. The target audience should be people with limited technical knowledge who may be interested in leveraging your project. We recommend using Google Slides, PowerPoint or Keynote to create your presentation slides. You will then record yourself delivering the presentation.

The non-technical presentation will consist of the slides themselves and a video recording of you giving the presentation. 
Be mindful about your annunciation and the pace of your speaking. It is often good practice to speak a bit slower than you are accustomed to when giving a presentation so that others can hear you clearly. 

## Submit Your Project

To submit your project in Canvas, you will create and upload PDF versions of two project deliverables (final notebook and presentation) and upload a recording of your video presentation to canvas.

### Presentation Slides PDF Creation

1. Export your presentation as a PDF from the program in which you created it.
2. Give it a short descriptive file name (e.g. `presentation.pdf`).
3. upload to canvas. 

### Jupyter Notebook PDF Creation

1. Open your Notebook in your browser (we recommend Google Chrome).
2. **Run the Notebook from start to finish** so that your output is visible.
3. Save the page as a PDF using the browser's Print functionality ([Google Chrome Save to PDF instructions](https://www.wikihow.com/Save-a-Web-Page-as-a-PDF-in-Google-Chrome))
4. Give it a short descriptive file name (e.g. `notebook.pdf`).

If you have difficulty creating a PDF version of your notebook, you can use [this tool](https://htmtopdf.herokuapp.com/ipynbviewer/) instead. Set the ‘Results Format’ to “HTML + PDF”. Then click ‘View and Convert’. Once it’s done, you should see links to .html and .pdf versions above the ‘View and Convert’ button.

### PDF Submission in Canvas

You will need to submit the two PDF files as a single submission. 
Once the submission process has been started by clicking "Start Assignment" in the "Phase X Project Subimission" in Canvas:

1. Click "Submit Assignment" at the top of the "Phase X Project Submission" page in the canvas module.
2. In the "File Upload" box, click "Choose File" button to upload a single file.
3. Click the "Add Another File" link to upload an additional file.
4. Repeat Step 3 to upload one more file. After this is done, all three files should be uploaded.
5. Hit the blue "Submit Assignment" button.

### Presentation Recording and Submission

After you've submitted the PDF files for the project assignment, you will upload a recording of your presentation as a media comment on your submission:

1. Record your live presentation to a video file on your computer. We recommend using Zoom to record your live presentation to a local video file ([instructions here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-recording)). Video files must be under 500 MB and formatted as 3GP, ASF, AVI, FLV, M4V, MOV, MP4, MPEG, QT, or WMV.
2. Click "Submission Details" on the top right of the "Phase X Project Submission" page.
3. Click "Media Comment" beneath the "Add a Comment" box on the right of the page.
4. Click "Upload Media" and "Select Video File" to upload your file.
5. The thumbnail for your video will appear as a blue rectangle while Zoom processes your file - return to this page later to confirm that your recording uploaded successfully.

### 1. Deliver your PDF presentation to a non-technical stakeholder.
When delivering your presentation, imagine your instructor will play the part of a non-technical stakeholder that you are presenting your findings to. The presentation should be no less than 5 minutes and no more than 8 minutes. 

In the first half of the presentation (2-3 mins), you should summarize your methodology in a way that will be comprehensible to someone with no background in data analytics and that will increase their confidence in you and your findings. In the second half (the remaining 2-3 mins) you should summarize your findings.

### 2. Go through the Jupyter Notebook, answering questions about how you made certain decisions. Be ready to explain things like:
    * "How did you pick the question(s) that you did?"
    * "Why are these questions important from a business perspective?"
    * "How did you decide on the data cleaning options you performed?"
    * "Why did you choose a given method or library?"
    * "Why did you select those visualizations and what did you learn from each of them?"
    * "How would you interpret the results?"

## Grading

Your teachers will use the rubric at the bottom of the project submission page to grade your project. Your passing of the project is based on achieving 70% of the total possible points for the specific phase project. Your teachers will grade your submissions during the assessment week period.

## Conclusion

Thank you for your hard work on this project - you're going to do great! Remember that future employers will also look at your projects when deciding whether to hire you, so having complete, polished projects will help you tremendously not only to pass this assignment, but also to get the job you want after you graduate.

If you have any questions about the project submission or review process, don't hesitate to ask your teacher.
